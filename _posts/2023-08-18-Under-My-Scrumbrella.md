    <p>I'm spending some time formalizing my understanding of agile methodologies, and I was delighted to discover how pretty and informative the <a href="https://lnkd.in/gXcuq3-j" target="_blank">Agile Alliance website</a> is.</p>
    
    <p>One aspect in particular that I liked was their "subway map" of the whole Agile workflow.</p>
    
    <p>I find that I sometimes have familiarity with seemingly disparate concepts, without ever knowing just how related or complimentary they actually are. I liken it to moving to a new area, where you use your GPS to get to your job every day. Each day the GPS may take you on 1 of the 3 possible routes to your job. For a time, each of these 3 routes lives individually in its own slice of your world, unrelated. Eventually, you turn off the GPS, and realize with an internalized bird's-eye view exactly how each road flows in relation to the other 2.</p>
    
    <p>Likewise, I find that the subway map of Agile Workflows showed me where the things I already knew fit into the bigger picture of a proper Agile system.</p>
    
    <p>For years I've used Kanban boards for my projects on GitHub project space. I use this project tracking system and the issue tracking system both to help keep my head on straight with both solo and team projects both in and outside of school. I even Kanban aspects of my life, from home improvement projects to vacation planning.</p>
    
    <p>A couple of summers ago, I worked with a retired game industry developer/mentor. He taught me, as I've mentioned in previous posts, about "Daily Standup Meetings," which is another aspect in the Agile framework under the "Scrum Tribe." Standups are something I actively perform to this day in my Obsidian-based markdown journal. He also taught me other concepts that fall under this Scrumbrella, such as backlogs and sprints.</p>
    
    <p>Working in various team compositions over the years has exposed me to a lot of dysfunctional teams, middle-of-the-road teams, and epic-still-good-friends teams. The teams that were successful in their goals were always the ones that practiced at least some of the methodologies from the house of Agile.</p>
    
    <p>Thank you for your time!<br>-Josh ✌</p>
    
    <p><strong>P.S.</strong> Check out the map, it's insightful and information-rich.</p>
